1 thread calls dispatcher thread that takes work as an input
either directly from user or through http requests if its a web server

distributes work among a small number of dedicated worker threads using a shared queue

the worker threads are waiting for work to arrive through the queue and grab the task from it
as soon as they finish the current task

that queue is basically a data structure stored on the heap and is accessible by worker threads.
