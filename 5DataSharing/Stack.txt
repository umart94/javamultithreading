stack is memory region 

. methods are executed
. arguments are passed
. local variables are stored
. stack + instruction pointer = state of each thread's execution


all variables belong to the thread executing on that stack

stack is statically allocated when the thread is created

the size of stack is fixed and relatively small ( platform specific)

if our calling hierarchy is too deep we may get an stack overflow exception (risky with recursive calls)
