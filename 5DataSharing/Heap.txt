heap is a shared memory region that belongs to a process
all the threads share whatever data is allocated on the heap
and can access and allocate variables on the heap at any moment


what is allocated on the heap


. all objects are stored on the heap ( anything created with new operator)
. members of classes
. static variables ( are actually members of class)


heap is managed by garbage collector

objects stay as long as we have a reference to them ( same lifecycle as their parents)

static variables ( stay forever)


reference is not equal to object.


Object referenceVar1 = new Object();
Object referenceVar2 = referenceVar1; 


if references are declared inside a method they are allocated on the stack

can be allocated on the heap if they are members of a class.
