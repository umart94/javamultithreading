synchronized keyword

locking mechanism
used to restrict access to a critical section or entire method to a single thread at a time



there are two ways to declare it :


1. Synchronized - Monitor


public class ClassWithCriticalSections{

public synchronized method1(){
}

public synchronized method2(){
}


}


suppose that thread 1 is executing method1

and thread 2 wants to execute method1 and method2

thread 2 cannot execute method1 or method2 because 

SYNCHRONIZED IS APPLIED PER OBJECT , THE TERM FOR THAT IS CALLED A MONITOR




2. Synchronized - Lock

define block of code we consider critical section
use synchronized keyword to restrict access only to that section
without making the entire method synchronized


we need to create a object to synchronize on 
which will serve as a LOCK

THAT CAN BE ANY OBJECT INSIDE THE CLASS

ANY SYNCHRONIZED BLOCK WHICH IS SYNCHRONIZED ON SAME OBJECT WILL ALLOW ONLY 1 THREAD TO EXECUTE INSIDE THAT BLOCK








in method 1 - 1. Synchronized - Monitor

public synchronized method1(){
}

is logically equivalent to : 


public void method1(){

synchronized(this){

}


}










in method 2 2. Synchronized - Lock


public ClassWithCriticalSections{
Object lock1 = new Object();
Object lock2 = new Object();


public void method1(){
critical section
synchronized(lock1){

}
}


public void method2(){
critical section
synchronized(lock2){

}

}


}


thread A for example can access method1 with lock1

thread b can access method2 with lock2

threadb cannot access method1 with lock1 until threada has exited the critical section

notice that both method1 and method2 are whats called critical sections 



another benefit is that we dont have to synchronize the entire method

we can synchronize bare minimum amount of code to be synchronized








the synchronized block is whats called Reentrant

a thread cannot prevent itself from entering a critical section

if THREAD A IS ACCESSING A SYNCHRONIZED METHOD WHILE ALREADY BEING IN A DIFFERENT SYNCHRONIZED METHOD
OR BLOCK IT WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT SYNCHRONIZED METHOD WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
