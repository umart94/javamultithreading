a deadlock is a situation where everyone is  trying to make progress
but cannot because they are waiting for another party to make a move.


mutual exclusion - only one thread can have exclusive access to a resource
hold and wait - at least one thread is holding a resource and is waiting for
another resource

non premptive allocation - a resource is released only after the thread is done using it

circular wait - a chain of at least two threads each one is holding one resource and waiting for another resource.
