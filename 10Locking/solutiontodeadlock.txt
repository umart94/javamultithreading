avoiding circular wait
circular wait - a chain of at least two threads each one is holding one resource and waiting for another resource.


acquire the locks in the same order.


if locks are in huge amount of size then we can use a watchdog
restart threads if register value is not what is expected

thread interruption ( not possible with synchronized)

check if lock is already acquired by another thread
tryLock operation( not possible with synchronized)
